            <p>The air travel route map indicates that the Melbourne to Sydney route is Australia's busiest, 
                with over 221 million trips since 1984. The concentration of heavy passenger routes in the southeast, 
                around cities like Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne, highlights the 
                demand for travel between densely populated regions. Factors contributing to this 
                include the strong economic ties, frequent business travel, tourism, and 
                limited alternative travel options, making flying the most efficient form of 
                transport between these areas.</p>

            <p>The color gradient illustrates that routes with lighter traffic tend to connect remote 
                regions or less densely populated areas, such as the Northern Territory and parts of Western 
                Australia, where air travel is less frequent due to lower population density and less economic 
                activity. In these areas, flights may serve the mining sector, remote communities, or 
                regional tourism.</p>

            <p>The bottom graph, which can be applied as a date filter, shows a rise in the number 
                of air routes between 1984 and 2024, which can be attributed to factors such as market liberalisation, the 
                entrance of low-cost carriers, and an increase in consumer demand. The rise in 
                routes also reflects airport expansions, improved infrastructure, and growing 
                urban population, prompting airlines to increase their networks.</p>

            <p>The slight plateau in unique route numbers in the mid 2010s suggests a temporary saturation or 
                stabilisation of domestic routes, possibly due to consolidation in the airline industry or 
                limited new demand in established markets. However, the uptick toward 2018-2024 could indicate 
                renewed growth, possibly driven by regional development, new technologies, and increased tourism.</p>
